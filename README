QUICKNOTE
=========

There are 8 differents sets of Docker config available in there.

Their name has a shape looking as "system_version_option", detailed below ...

System : choose among "linux" or "windows" base according to hosting Operating System.

Version : decide between either stable ("official") or dev/beta ("sandbox").

Option :
- for external or localhost existing SQL service, opt for "botonly" (= 1 container just for bot)
- otherwise if have no SQL service yet, go for "botplusdb" (= 2 containers : 1 for SQL + 1 for bot)

Example 1 :
Windows 10 host and wanting a stable version with a new dedicated SQL => "windows_official_botplusdb"
Example 2 :
Debian 12 host and experimental version for an existing SQL => "linux_sandbox_botonly"

More details are provided within upper linked documentation.
